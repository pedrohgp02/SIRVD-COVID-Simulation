# SIRVD-COVID-Simulation

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for modeling the spread of COVID-19 in Brazil during 2021 using the SIRVD (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered, Vaccinated, Deceased) model. The project demonstrates numerical simulation through Euler's method and includes both deterministic and agent-based approaches to capture disease dynamics.

## Introduction
The primary objective of this project is to simulate the spread of COVID-19 using a modified SIR model (SIRVD) and to compare the results with an agent-based model (ABM) implemented in Python. The SIRVD model includes compartments for vaccinated and deceased individuals, providing a more detailed representation of disease dynamics.

## SIRVD Model
The SIRVD model is an extension of the classic SIR model, incorporating additional compartments for vaccinated and deceased individuals. The model uses differential equations to describe the flow of individuals between compartments.

## Numerical Simulation
The numerical simulation is performed using Euler's method, a straightforward technique for solving differential equations. The Python implementation provides a clear visualization of the disease dynamics over time.

## Agent-Based Modeling
The agent-based model (ABM) simulates individual interactions within a population. Each agent represents an individual with specific attributes and behaviors, allowing for a more granular and realistic simulation of disease spread.
